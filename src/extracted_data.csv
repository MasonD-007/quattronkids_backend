Instead of using thermal gap pads to conduct heat from the CPU to the system’s interface to the cold plate, GMS uses RuggedCool™ which employs a corrugated alloy slug with an extremely low thermal resistance to act as a heat spreader at the processor die. Once the heat is spread, a liquid silver compound in a sealed chamber is used to transfer the heat from the spreader to the system’s enclosure. This approach yields a temperature delta of less than 10°C from the CPU core to the cold plate and increases shock and vibe resistance.
